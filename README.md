# USB_MSC_U5

I have some problems starting USB MSC device type on a STM32U5 using AZURE.

I posted here my full project and some info about the problem. The project started from a CUBEMX project, then I edited some files to finalize the project. 

In the "source" folder there are some of this **important** files.

After the program is running, I see this new device on the **Device Manager**:
